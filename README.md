## Introduction
   
About four years ago, I'm starting learning computer science. but now I'm still a loser on it and i am willing to keep studing it.
  
**I just want to use this repository to train myself in CS and English.**

## Plan
  
* create an orderedLinkedList extend from LinkedList. this class will rewrite three methods of LinkedList.  
	1. contains(T t)  
	2. add(T t)  
	3. remove(T t)  
* use linux command **tree** to make a folder tree for this repository.  
* update the LinkedList class. add a variable to point the last node of this list.
